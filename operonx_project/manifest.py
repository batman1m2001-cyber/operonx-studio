"""``operonx.toml`` — the project manifest.

A manifest answers the three questions no tool can infer from source alone:

1. **Which graphs are entry points?** A module may define components and
   runnable graphs side by side; only the author knows which is which.
2. **What must be injected to build them?** Ops produced by an
   ``@op_factory`` do not exist until a dependency is supplied, so a graph
   cannot be constructed — let alone drawn — without a declared binding.
3. **Where do resources come from?** An optional shared base hub merged
   under a project-specific overlay.

Everything else about a project is derived: input ports come from the entry
signature, required env keys come from ``${VAR}`` in the resource files.

Example::

    [project]
    name = "callbot"
    src  = ["src", "."]     # import roots; defaults to ["."]

    [resources]
    base    = "~/.operonx/common.yaml"
    overlay = "resources.yaml"

    [[graph]]
    name  = "ws_callbot_pipeline"
    entry = "callbot.graph:build_ws_callbot_pipeline"
    [graph.bind]
    agent = "agents.ahamove_hr.agent:AhamoveHRAgent"

    """What puts work into a graph.

    The IR records nodes, edges and entries, all derived from the graph
    itself. Nothing derived can say what *calls* it, so a served pipeline
    renders as if it begins from nowhere — a socket handler and a cron job
    look identical, and the environment contract cannot mention the port
    the thing actually listens on.

    This is the missing half, and it is a declaration rather than a
    discovery because the answer is not in the code: uvicorn calls an ASGI
    route, which starts a run. That hop is not an op and cannot be made
    one, so it is written down instead.

    It is no longer only descriptive. `operonx.core.manifest` reads the
    same block and boots from it, so this is now the one place a
    deployment is defined — which is why `graph` may name an entry point
    directly rather than pointing at a `[[graph]]` that exists only to

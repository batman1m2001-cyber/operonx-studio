"""Build a project's graphs and serialise them to the Project IR.

The IR is **derived and disposable** — never committed. Git carries source;
this is a cache the UI reads so it never has to parse Python.

Two sources, deliberately:

* **The built graph supplies semantics.** Ops produced by an ``@op_factory``
  do not exist until something is injected, so nothing short of building can
  see them. This is why extraction executes project code, and why one
  process handles one project.
* **The AST supplies source anchors.** ``BaseOp`` records no construction
  site. For a ``FuncOp`` we can recover one from ``code_fn.__code__``, but a
  class-based op (``LLMOp``, ``EmitOp``) has none — its class lives in
  operonx, not in the project. C3 guarantees an op's name is its assignment
  variable, so the two views line up by name.

Reading values is done through ``object.__getattribute__`` against a type
whitelist. ``Ref.__getattr__`` *builds a new Ref* for any attribute asked of
it, so an ordinary ``hasattr`` probe fabricates objects instead of answering
a question (finding S9).

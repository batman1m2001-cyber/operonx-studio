"""Surgical edits to a project's config files.

Every function here takes the file's text and returns new text, changing
only the span that must change. Nothing is parsed and re-serialised.

That is not fastidiousness. Measured on the three real resource files in
this workspace, a parse-and-reserialise round-trip through PyYAML drops
57–76% of each file and every comment in it:

    ex16   resources.yaml   1735b -> 422b    (34 comment lines gone)
    operon resources.yaml   5668b -> 2432b   (68 comment lines gone)
    callbot resources.yaml  3555b -> 1098b   (45 comment lines gone)

Those comments are the file's documentation — the two-store explanation,
the HNSW opclass warning, why a block is commented out. A UI that silently
deleted them while "saving your resource change" would be worse than one
that could not edit at all.

Hence the contract every function upholds, and every test asserts:

    **An edit that changes nothing returns the input byte for byte.**

That makes the round-trip gate trivially true rather than aspirational, and
means a save that touches one value produces a one-line diff a reviewer can
read.

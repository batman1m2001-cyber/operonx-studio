"""Layered DAG layout for a Project IR graph.

Layout lives in Python rather than the browser for three reasons: it is
deterministic (the same IR always draws the same picture, so a screenshot
diff means something), it is testable without a headless browser, and it
keeps the rendered page a thin view rather than a second implementation.

The algorithm is Sugiyama's, minus the parts that do not pay for themselves
at operonx's graph sizes:

1. **Layer** by longest path from the entry set, so every edge points
   forward and an edge never spans backwards.
2. **Order** within each layer by repeated barycentre sweeps, which is what
   actually removes crossings.
3. **Place** on a fixed grid.

Back-edges are excluded from layering — a cycle has already been rewritten
into a hidden loop by the time we see it, and the surviving record lives in
``rewritten_from``. Drawing one as a forward edge would put a node in a
layer that contradicts the loop boundary it belongs to.
